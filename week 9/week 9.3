def coinChange(n):
    coins = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    min_coins = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    min_coins[0] = 0
    for amount in range(1, n + 1):
        for coin in coins:
            if amount - coin >= 0:
               min_coins[amount] = min(min_coins[amount], min_coins[amount - coin] + 1)
    return min_coins[n]
