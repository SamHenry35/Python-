Write a program to print all the locations at which a particular element (taken as input) is found in a list and also print the total number of times it occurs in the list. The location starts from 1.

 

For example, if there are 4 elements in the array:

 

5

6

5

7

 

If the element to search is 5 then the output will be:

 

5 is present at location 1

5 is present at location 3

5 is present 2 times in the array.

 

Sample Test Cases

 

Test Case 1

 

Input

 

4

5

6

5

7

5

 

Output

 

5 is present at location 1.

5 is present at location 3.

5 is present 2 times in the array.

 

Test Case 2

 

Input

 

5

67

80

45

97

100

50

 

Output

 

50 is not present in the array.

def find_locations(arr, element):
    # Initialize variables to store locations and count of occurrences
    locations = []
    count = 0
    
    # Iterate through the list
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        # If the element is found, add its location to the locations list and increment the count
        if arr[i] == element:
            locations.append(i + 1)  # Adding 1 to convert zero-based index to one-based index
            count += 1
    
    return locations, count

# Input size of the list
n = int(input())

# Input the list elements
arr = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]

# Input the element to search
element = int(input())

# Find the locations and count of occurrences of the element
locations, count = find_locations(arr, element)

# Output the locations and count
if count > 0:
    for location in locations:
        print(f"{element} is present at location {location}.")
    print(f"{element} is present {count} times in the array.")
else:
    print(f"{element} is not present in the array.")
