An online retailer sells two products: widgets and gizmos. Each widget weighs 75 grams. Each gizmo weighs 112 grams. Write a program that reads the number of widgets and the number of gizmos from the user. Then your program should compute and display the total weight of the parts.

Sample Input:

10

20

Sample Output:

The total weight of all these widgets and gizmos is 2990 grams.

w=int(input())
g=int(input())
t1=w*75
t2=g*112
total=t1+t2
print("The total weight of all these widgets and gizmos is",total,"grams.")
