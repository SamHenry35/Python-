There is a malfunctioning keyboard where some letter keys do not work. All other keys on the keyboard work properly.

Given a string text of words separated by a single space (no leading or trailing spaces) and a string brokenLetters of all distinct letter keys that are broken, return the number of words in text you can fully type using this keyboard.

Example 1:

Input: text = "hello world", brokenLetters = "ad"

Output: 

1

Explanation: We cannot type "world" because the 'd' key is broken.


For example:
Input 	Result

hello world
ad

            break
    if(flag==0):
        c+=1
